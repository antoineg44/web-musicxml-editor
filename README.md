# Web Editor of MusicXML Files
Browser based music score editor with basic MusicXML import/export. Uses Vexflow for music engraving into HTML5 svg element. Provides mouse interactivity for manipulation with musical score.

You can see live demo [here](https://antoineg44.github.io/web-musicxml-editor/).

## Dependencies
Vexflow, jQuery and Bootstrap

## Current limitations
<ul>
  <li>Missing check if notes fit the bar. Only one note can be added into measure.</li>
  <li>Minimal subset of MusicXML format supported.</li>
  <li>Editor works with only first musical part of music score.</li>
</ul>

## To Do
<ol>
  <li>Duration check for notes in measure - in progress</li>
  <li>Playback - basics done, improvements needed</li>
  <li>Bug fixes - in progress</li>
  <li>Chords support - waiting</li>
  <li>Keyboard interactivity - waiting</li>
  <li>Multiple score parts - waiting</li>
</ol>
